We conducted an experiment to determine the optimal selling price for a new premium chocolate bar across six stores.

### Experimental Data

| Store | Price (â‚¬) | Units Sold |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| 1     | 20        | 0          |
| 2     | 16        | 3          |
| 3     | 15        | 7          |
| 4     | 16        | 4          |
| 5     | 13        | 6          |
| 6     | 19        | 10         |

### Analysis Steps

1. **Scatter Plot**: A scatter plot was created to visualize the relationship between price and units sold.
  
2. **Simple Linear Regression**: The parameters of the regression line (slope \(b_1\) and intercept \(b_0\)) were computed to model the relationship.

3. **Regression Line**: The regression line was added to the scatter plot to show the predicted units sold based on price.

4. **Coefficient of Determination (\(R^2\))**: This metric was calculated to assess the goodness of fit of the regression model.

This analysis will help guide pricing strategies for the new chocolate bar.
